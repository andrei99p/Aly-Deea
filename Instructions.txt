Step 1: Structure and Aesthetic

	Layout: Clean, modular sections with lots of white space

	Color Palette: Red primary color, white background, dark text, with soft pastel accents

	Typography: Friendly, geometric sans-serif fonts (similar to Inter, DM Sans, or Poppins)

	Imagery: Custom illustrations, icons, minimalistic animations

	Call to Actions (CTAs): Prominent buttons with consistent styling

	Navigation: Sticky top nav

	Footer: Multi-column layout with links and branding

Step 2: Set Up

	Typography styles (H1-H6, body, buttons)

	Color palette (primary, secondary, neutral grays, background, accents)

	Buttons (primary, secondary, ghost)

	Form fields (inputs)

	Navigation & footer components

	Cards and icon blocks

Step 3: Define the Page Structure (Wireframe Level)

	1 Top Navigation Bar

		Logo left


	2 Hero Section

		Left-aligned headline + subtext

		Right-aligned illustration or image

		Primary CTA button + secondary link

	3 Logo Strip

		Trusted by logos (grayscale for visual harmony)

	4 Feature Blocks

		Zigzag layout: Text left, image right (and alternates)

		Icons for each feature

	5 Product/Benefit Highlights

		Reusable grid or tabs with simple icons

	6 Testimonials / Social Proof

		Cards with photos

	7 Call-to-Action Section

		Large CTA with supporting text

	8 Footer

		Contact information

STEP 4: Design Components

	1 Typography

		H1: 48px bold
		H2: 36px semi-bold

		Simple icons in SVG or icon font (e.g., Lucide, Feather, Heroicons)

	5 Animations

		Light fade-ins on scroll
		Hover states on buttons and cards

STEP 5: Create Full Mockups
	
	1 Pages to include:

		Optimize buttons and form fields for touch
